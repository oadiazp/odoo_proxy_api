# Odoo proxy API
The current web development is based on REST but Odoo is still using XML-RPC so the idea behind this project is to build a REST API that proxies the requests to Odoo. We want to expose the same methods that the Odoo API has over REST so the front-end development with the modern frameworks can be Odoo-independent.
